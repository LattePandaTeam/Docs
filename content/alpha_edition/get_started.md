### Instructions

!!! warning
    LattePanda is relatively special in product form design, and also open the PC technology to provide more possibilities for development and IoT innovation. 
    
    But CPU related products are all **electrostatic sensitive**, so although we adopt the **anti-static design**, users still need to be careful in use. 
    
    BE SURE to REMOVE the static electricity from your body before touching LattePanda board! Otherwise it may cause potential static discharge and damage your LattePanda!

* Connect Wifi antennas to sockets.
