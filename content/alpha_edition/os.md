Make sure to select your USB. Then go to the 'Save and Exit' tab on the top right. Choose the 'Save Changes and Exit' option. Your LP should restart, and it should boot directly from your USB.

5.Install and set up Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on your LP. 

Once your LP restarts, the following page should appear.

There will be two options:

- Try Ubuntu without installing
- Install Ubuntu

Both options should work, but in this tutorial I will install Ubuntu and I recommend you doing so also. 

After that option is selected, the installation will begin. A screen like the picture below will appear, this process might take a while. Please be patient while leaving your LP on for the installation to take place.

Once the installation is finished. A few more setup options for your Ubuntu OS, and it will be ready to use.

!!!note
    During this process the screen may go black, please be patient. Do not do anything until your laptop displays the following screen.

Choose your default language and continue.

Check the box to install third-party software, and then continue. This will ensure the common plugins are installed so everything can run smoothly. 

<center>![](https://i.imgur.com/ZBEtaik.jpg?1)</center>

Choose the best option for you. The options may look slightly different on your screen, but normally the third option (Erase disk and install Ubuntu) would be the most appropriate. There will be a small window to confirm that changes can be made to your disk. Please click continue.

Choose your time zone and click continue to proceed.

Fill out your details to continue. You will be asked to restart your LP in order to complete installation.

## Hackintosh (Mac OS)

Since the LattePanda Alpha shares similar hardware as some Macbooks, it is possible to install Mac OS Mojave on the LattePanda Alpha. In fact, some community members have already done this and posted installation tutorials. One such member, Novaspirit, created a very detailed tutorial video along with some installation files. 

!!! note
    Mac OS is not an officially supported operating system. Some functionality may not work, or may require additional hardware to work. For example, the provided LattePanda Wifi card is not supported. A USB or M.2 E-key Wifi card is required to have Wifi on Mac OS.**
