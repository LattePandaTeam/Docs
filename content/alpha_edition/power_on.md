First of all, let me show you how to boot your LattePanda as a normal PC!

## Step 3: Connect Adapter & Power on

In our box, we provide the power supply adapter. Plug in the Type C cable from the power supply adapter and wait few seconds until the Blue LED light off. Then hold the power button for 3 seconds to power on the device.
