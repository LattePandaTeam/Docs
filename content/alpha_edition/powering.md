# Powering On

This document describes the different ways you can power your LattePanda. It will cover the input specification, what you will need, and installation steps.


## Overview

**4 Ways for powering your Alpha in different applications:**

1. Official PD adapter comes with LattePanda Alpha
2. External PD power bank
3. [12 volts input from JST PH2.0 - 4P connector][1]
4. [Lipo battery from 10p power connector][2]

## Type-C PD Adapters and Battery Banks

### Input Specification

* Accepts Power Delivery compliant devices with 45W output (Up to 36 watts will be good enough actually.)

### What You Will Need

* USB Type C Power Delivery power supply or battery

### Installation Steps

1. Connect the USB Type C power supply to the outlet.
2. Connect the USB Type C connector to the LattePanda Alpha USB Type C port or to an attached USB Type C hub with Power Delivery pass through.

### Recommended Power Banks

* Or any other brand power bank supporting PD protocol with up to 36 watts output

## JST 4p DC Input Connector

!!! warning
    Please make sure to protect the system powering from wrong power connections for positive and negative pins!!! And review your powering connection again and again before powering the system.

The voltage range of Alpha power input connector is 7.4~15 volts. So if you're choosing the lipo battery, it should be 2~4 cells. The standard power source is 3A @ 12 volts. The booting power is like 10 watts. And operation power is like 5 watts without much load.

### Input Specification

* 7.4-15 volts
* Up to 36 watts is recommended 
* Standard power - 3A @ 12 volts
* JST PH2.0 - 4p connector (pin mapping is marked on the board also: -- DC ++, which means two negative pins and two positive pins)

You can check the [details about pinout diagram][5].

## Lipo Battery Connector

!!! warning
    Please make sure to protect the system powering from wrong power connections for 10 pins lipo battery. **There's same standard from different lipo battery vendors for this 10p connector. It means you may need to change pin mapping carefully based on the battery you purchased from local vendor!**

    And wrong power connection will definitely break for LattePanda Alpha!!!

### Recommended Batteries

We didn't offically release battery supported list from LattePanda yet. Somehow global battery shipping is not easy. And it's even hard to find a standard battery for global market when every place has different resources available. 
But You can check the <a href="https://www.lattepanda.com/topic-f13t16675.html?hilit=battery&start=31" target="_blank">forum discussion about this topic.</a>. Community members already find some alternatives from local battery vendors.

!!! tips
    This 10-pin Li-Po in connector is meant for well-protected (BMS + balancer at minimum) battery pack, not for raw Li-Po/Li-Ion/LiFePO4 cells.   
    (e.g., latter setup will drain below the minimum Li-Po cell voltage which will significantly/irreversibly degrade the life expectancy of cell.)
    Also charging without proper CI (then later CV) charging circuit is outright dangerous.

### Input Specification
* **7.4 - 8.2 V**, means 2-cell Lipo battery
* Recommend at least 5 Ah battery

### Installation Steps

1. Align the 10p battery connector with the LattePanda Alpha battery connector. Make sure the red wires align with pins 1-3 on the diagram above.
2. Connect the 10p battery connector to the LattePanda Alpha battery connector.

!!! warning
    Only recommended for advanced makers, who have enough hardware experience...
