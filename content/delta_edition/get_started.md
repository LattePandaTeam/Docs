### Instructions

!!! warning
    The LattePanda is relatively special in its product form and design, and it can also interface with other PC technology to provide more possibilities for development and IoT innovations. 
    

    However, the CPU related products are all **electrostatically sensitive**, so, although we have adopted an **anti-static design**, users will still need to be careful when using these electronics. 
    
    BE SURE TO REMOVE the static electricity from your body before touching the LattePanda computer board! Otherwise, this may cause potential static discharge and damage your LattePanda!

* Connect Wifi antennas to the sockets.

!!! Tip
    You can purchase enhanced antennas to enhance the WIFI and Bluetooth signal strength!
