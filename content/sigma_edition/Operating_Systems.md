# Operating Systems

This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to install an operating system that is compatible with LattePanda Sigma. It covers the acceptable bootup media and provides instructions and resources for installing operating systems, as well as special considerations to keep in mind.

## Compatible System List

We've tested the basic functions of various operating systems on LattePanda Sigma and compiled a compatibility table.

| Operating System | Test Version | Compatibility | Note |
| ------- | ------- | :----: | --- |
| Windows 11 | 22H2 | ðŸŸ¢    |      |
| Windows 10 | 22H2 | ðŸŸ¢    |      |
| Windows Server 2022 | April 2023 | ðŸŸ¡ | The NIC driver needs to be manually installed, please see [Installation Tutorial](https://docs.lattepanda.com/content/sigma_edition/Operating_Systems/#windows-server) |
| Ubuntu  | 20.04.6 | ðŸŸ¢    |      |
| Ubuntu  | 22.04.2 | ðŸŸ¢    |      |
| Rocky Linux | 9.1 | ðŸŸ¢    |      |
| Proxmox VE | 7.4  | ðŸŸ¡    | Due to lack of driver support for the new generation of core graphics card, the GUI can not automatically start, please see [Installation Tutorial](https://docs.lattepanda.com/content/sigma_edition/Operating_Systems/#proxmox-ve) |
| VMware ESXi | 8.0 U1  | ðŸŸ¡ | Intel CPUs with P-core and E-core are not officially supported, you can install them by adding additional parameters, please see [Installation Tutorial](https://docs.lattepanda.com/content/sigma_edition/Operating_Systems/#vmware-esxi) |
| TrueNAS CORE | 13.0-U4 | ðŸŸ¢ |      |
| Android x86 | 9.0-r2 | ðŸ”´ |      |
| ChromeOS Flex | 15117.112.0 | ðŸ”´ | |
| OPNsense | 23.1   | ðŸŸ¢    |      |

\> [!NOTE] 

>   ðŸŸ¢ Green indicates that the OS can be installed normally. Basic interfaces such as USB, HDMI, Ethernet, PCIe, and SATA can be identified and used without any additional steps; 
>
>   ðŸŸ¡ Yellow indicates that additional installation or setup steps are required before the system can be fully installed and operational; 
>
>   ðŸ”´ Red indicates that the OS cannot be installed completely, either due to hardware or software issues.
>
> * The E-core to P-core performance efficiency, Thunderbolt 4 interfaces and the drivers for integrated graphics cards are not included in the compatibility testing, as these can change rapidly with system updates. Additionally, the Thunderbolt 4 interface is difficult to use outside of the Windows desktop system, and therefore was not included in our testing range.

If you discover that an operating system has undergone a significant update and needs to be retested, or if there are other operating systems that you would like us to test, you can either create a new issue in the repository of this document (https://github.com/LattePandaTeam/Docs/issues) or email us at [techsupport@lattepanda.com](mailto:techsupport@lattepanda.com).

!!! Warning
    It is highly recommended to create a backup of your important files or data before proceeding with the installation of an operating system on LattePanda Sigma.

## Windows

<center>![](/assets/images/Windows_10_11_logo.jpg)</center>

The following contents will take the Windows OS installation as an example to demonstrate. 

\> [!NOTE] 

> * The installation steps for both Windows 10 and Windows 11 are the same. 
> * We will use the official system image file(provided by LattePanda team) with all hardware drivers pre-installed and ready to use, bringing you a fast and ultimate experience.



### What You Will Need

* Empty USB flash drive (16 GB or larger)
* M.2 NVMe SSD(or SATA SSD)

## VMware ESXi

VMware ESXi is a software program that enables virtualization, allowing multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical host. It is used to create and manage virtual machines, providing a cost-effective and efficient way to utilize hardware resources, simplify IT management, and increase server utilization.

As ESXi does not support Intel's hybrid consumer CPU architecture that integrates two types of CPU cores: **Performance-cores** (P-cores) and **Efficienct-cores** (E-cores) into the same physical CPU die, you may encounter a PSOD (Purple Screen of Death) when attempting to power on a virtual machine on LattePanda Sigma, resulting in the following exception:

![ESXI_PSOD](https://dfimg.dfrobot.com/nobody/wiki/861d87a7713e5f32be9faefd27851019.png)

The error code indicates that the issue is caused by CPU incompatibility. However, there is a workaround available that does not require disabling the E-Cores or P-Cores.

### Solution

To resolve the issue, we will add an ESXi kernel boot option that disables the CPU uniformity check. Please refer to the instructions below for more details.

* **STEP 1** 

- When booting up the ESXi installer, you will be prompted to append additional ESXi kernel boot settings. Press **SHIFT+O** and add the following kernel option to the command line: **cpuUniformityHardCheckPanic=FALSE**. Then press enter to continue with the boot process.

![](https://dfimg.dfrobot.com/nobody/wiki/f7f0b737bd480a06cc63f3e10224551e.jpg)

- Install ESXi by following the install wizard and once you are prompted to reboot, **DO NOT reboot yet**. We still need to add the kernel option again so that ESXi can successfully boot after the installation. 

![reboot_page](https://dfimg.dfrobot.com/nobody/wiki/e1799abf0370c30b855a1d217df44c92.jpg)

* **STEP 2**

- Switch into the ESXi shell by pressing **ALT+F1**. 
- Login using **'root'** and blank password as ESXi has not gone through full reboot and is not using the configured password. and Edit **vi /vmfs/volumes/BOOTBANK1/boot.cfg** 

![step03](https://dfimg.dfrobot.com/nobody/wiki/422002685ee1714e35c6aec1827c181f.jpg)

- Append following kernel option **cpuUniformityHardCheckPanic=FALSE** to existing kernelopt entry, which should look like the following:

â€‹		`kernelopt=weaselInstalled autoPartition=FALSE cpuUniformityHardCheckPanic=FALSE`

![](https://dfimg.dfrobot.com/nobody/wiki/5c965acb1c476617f4a3a6ab016bcb9f.jpg)

- Save your changes by pressing **'wq'** and then change back to the reboot prompt by pressing **ALT+F2** and then reboot.
- Instead of having to manually append the ESXi kernel option, you will notice that it has been appended and applying the setting in the boot.cfg file.

![](https://dfimg.dfrobot.com/nobody/wiki/c905b91fad6dc6d9f60d615ec83a0687.png)

* **STEP 3** 

To permanently configure the ESXi kernel boot setting, in case of updates/upgrades in the future, we can set the kernel setting using ESXCLI. 

- Login to DCUI by pressing **F2**. 

![](https://dfimg.dfrobot.com/nobody/wiki/b7b75f74dbd0efe4aac74462f82b5e76.png)

- Navigating to **Troubleshooting Option**.

![](https://dfimg.dfrobot.com/nobody/wiki/9e1c6e360069513669e25ad70d33dda1.png)

- Enable **ESXi Shell.**

![](https://dfimg.dfrobot.com/nobody/wiki/261472a16217589638daff8797b796be.png)

* **STEP 4**

Switch into the ESXi shell by pressing **ALT+F1**. Then login with '**root**' and the password you had configured during installation. Now run the following ESXCLI command to configure the kernel option:

`esxcli system settings kernel set -s cpuUniformityHardCheckPanic -v FALSE`

![](https://dfimg.dfrobot.com/nobody/wiki/c0b0c496bda6dfb7291fe18e01b7bc89.png)

* **STEP 5**

Reboot it by executing the command "**reboot**". Now, you can run VMware ESXi on your LattePanda Sigma.
