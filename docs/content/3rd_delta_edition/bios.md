!!! Note
    The **`Turn on Fast Startup`** option is initially **disabled** in our system image file, ensuring that the LattePanda device shuts down completely when turned off. Alternatively, if this option is enabled, the device will enter a hibernate state upon shutdown. This behavior is a result of the power management functionality within the Windows operating system. Kindly be mindful to verify this setting as it may have an impact on the system status.
