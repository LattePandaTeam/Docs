# Drivers and Software

## Regular Drivers
You can utilize the Intel Driver & Support Assistant (Intel DSA) to install and update your Alpha drivers.

Intel DSA can auto-detect the relevant drivers and updates you need according to your CPU model, which is very simple and convenient. Let's start using it!



1) First, download the [Intel Driver & Support Assistant](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html) application on Intel's website.



2) Run Intel DSA, and it will start to auto-detect drivers and updates for you. (Please use the Google Chrome browser to open the DSA, as other browsers may cause an Intel DSA detection error.)

3) Follow the on-screen prompts to download and install the drivers and updates.



## Touch Panel Drivers

The touch panel driver for Alpha is the same as that for LattePanda V1.0.

[Windows 10 Drivers (V1.1) - 64Bit](https://github.com/LattePandaTeam/LattePanda-Win10-Software/raw/master/Drivers/4G64GB_Drivers/Touch/64%20bit%20GoodixTouchDriver%20v1.1.rar)



PLEASE NOTE: 

“install.bat” must be run as administrator to update the driver correctly.
