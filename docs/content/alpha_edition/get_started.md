    In some countries, the LattePanda Alpha comes without a wall adapter and has to be bought separately.

!!! note
    If your device is the **LattePanda Alpha 800**, which comes without eMMC storage onboard, you will need a boot drive with an operating system installed on it.

### Instructions

!!! warning
    LattePanda has a relatively special product form design, and the PC technology provided can offer you more possibilities for hardware development and IoT innovation. 
    
    However, CPU-related products are all **electrostatically sensitive**, so, although the LP SBC adopts an **anti-static design**, users will still need to be careful when using this device. 
    
    BE SURE TO REMOVE the static electricity from your body before touching the LattePanda board! Otherwise, you may cause a potential static discharge and damage your LattePanda SBC!
