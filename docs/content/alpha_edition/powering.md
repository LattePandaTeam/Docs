* Or any other brand of power bank which supports PD protocol with up to 36 watts of output.

## JST 4p DC Input Connector

!!! warning
    Please make sure that the positive and negative pins are connected correctly! Double-check the power connection before powering on the system. 

The voltage range of the Alpha power input connector is 11~15 volts. So if you're choosing the LiPo battery, it should be 3~4 cells. The standard power source is 3A @ 12 volts. The booting power is about 10 watts and operating power is about 5 watts with a limited electrical load.

### Input Specification

* 11-15 volts
* Up to 36 watts is recommended 
* Standard power - 3A @ 12 volts
* JST PH2.0 - 4p connector (pin mapping is marked on the board, as well: -- DC ++, which means two negative pins and two positive pins)

## LiPo Battery Connector

!!! warning
    Please make sure that the 10 pin sequence of the LiPo battery is connected correctly. **Many vendors provide LiPo batteries with 10pin connectors. You may need to change the pins' sequence carefully based on the battery you purchased!**

    Any improperly connected power supply could damage your LattePanda Alpha!!!

### Recommended Batteries

We haven't officially released the list of batteries which are confirmed to work with the LattePanda Alpha yet.  It can be difficult to find and ship even standard batteries globally. 
But You can check the <a href="https://www.lattepanda.com/topic-f13t16675.html?hilit=battery&start=31" target="_blank">Here is a forum discussion regarding this topic.</a>. Community members have already found some alternatives from local battery vendors.

!!! tips
    This 10-pin Li-Po connector is meant to be a well-protected (BMS + balancer at minimum) battery pack, and is not intended for raw Li-Po/Li-Ion/LiFePO4 cells.   
    (e.g., the latter setup will drain energy until it is below the minimum Li-Po cell voltage required, which will significantly/irreversibly degrade the life expectancy of the cell.)
    Also, charging without the proper CI (then later CV) charging circuit is outright dangerous.

### Input Specification
* **7.4 - 8.2 V**, means 2-cell LiPo battery
* 5 Ah battery, where 5 Ah is the minimum recommended power rating
* LiPo battery must be able to charge at a CCCV rating of 1.9! Please check battery specification for charging current before using the battery.

### Installation Steps

1. Align the 10p battery connector with the LattePanda Alpha battery connector. Make sure the positive red wires align with the pins 1-3 on the diagram above.
2. Connect the 10p battery connector to the LattePanda Alpha battery connector.

### Considerations When Using Battery Connector

When using only the 10p battery connector to power LattePanda Alpha, the red and blue initializing lights will not turn on. Hold the power button for 3 seconds and the LattePanda Alpha will boot.


!!! warning
    We only recommended this procedure for advanced makers who have accumulated a vast amount of experience working with hardware...
