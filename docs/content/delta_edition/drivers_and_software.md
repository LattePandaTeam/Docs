# Drivers and Software

## Regular Drivers

We use the Intel Driver & Support Assistant (Intel DSA) to install and update Delta drivers.

The Intel DSA can auto-detect the relevant drivers or updates that you need according to your CPU model, which makes things very simple and convenient. Let's start!



1) First, download the [Intel Driver & Support Assistant](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html) Application on the Intel website.



2) Run Intel DSA, and it will start to auto-detect drivers and updates for you. (Please use the Google Chrome browser to open this, as other browsers may cause Intel DSA detection errors.)

3) Follow the on-screen prompts to download and install the drivers or updates.



!!! note
    Some users have reported that the driver of PCI Data Acquisition and Signal Processing Controller is still missing after installing all the drivers that the guide requests. We suggest that you try to install a third party software to fix this issue, such as the [Driver Booster 7](https://www.iobit.com/en/driver-booster.php).



## Touch Panel Drivers

The touch panel driver for the Delta is the same as that for the LattePanda V1.0.

PLEASE NOTE: 

“install.bat” must be run as administrator to update the driver correctly.
