Generally refers to the leader in a wolf pack, α / Alpha. It will also be the leader in the LattePanda series, the most powerful in performance. Known as the leader of the Pandas, or "AlphaPanda" for short.

The Alpha Edition uses the same Intel 7th generation Core m3 processor as the latest MacBook. The Core m3 processor is the perfect choice for superior performance and low power consumption.

A LattePanda also includes an integrated Arduino compatible co-processor, which means it can be used to control and sense the physical world! Whether you are a Windows developer, IoT developer, DIY fanatic, interactive designer, robotics whizz, or maker, a LattePanda single board computer can aid your creative process! 

# Delta Edition

Mathematical Character △; a triangle. In terms of product design, performance, price and power consumption, it signals a compromise between the three. It keeps the perfect balancing. Balancing is always the best and reflects the beauty of engineering.

The Delta Edition uses an Intel 8th generation Celeron N4100 processor. This Celeron processor is the perfect choice for features and price as a main robotics controller, interactive project core, IoT edge device or AI brain. So LattePanda Delta is still x86 based SBC design.
