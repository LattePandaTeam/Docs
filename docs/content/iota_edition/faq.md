| **Sudden Shutdown or Restart** | **Cause:** Insufficient power supply.<br>**Solution:** Ensure you are using a power adapter rated for **at least 24W (e.g., 12V/2A or higher)**. Adapters with lower wattage may cause system instability or unexpected shutdowns under load. |
| **Cooling Fan Doesn't Start**  | **Cause 1:** The fan is temperature-controlled and remains off until the system reaches a predefined thermal threshold.<br>**Solution 1:** This is normal behavior. The fan will activate automatically when needed.<br><br>**Cause 2:** Fan trigger temperature may be set too high.<br>**Solution 2:** Enter the BIOS and adjust the fan control settings to your preference. Refer to the BIOS User Guide for detailed instructions. |
