## :material-power: Power Button

This button functions almost the same as the power button on your laptop, as shown below:

=== "Power On"

    When the board is in a **shutdown or hibernation** state, a **short press** of the power button will turn it on.

=== "Wake Up"

    When the board is in **sleep** mode, a **short press** of the power button will wake it up.

=== "Sleep / Shut Down"

    When the board is **running normally**, a **short press** of the power button will trigger a preset action, which is typically **Sleep** by default.<br>:material-note:You can customize this behavior in your operating system's power settings. For example, in Windows, you can navigate to `Control Panel` > `Hardware and Sound` > `Power Options` > `Choose what the power buttons do` to change the action to "Shut down," "Do nothing," etc.

=== "Force Shut Down"

    If the OS becomes unresponsive or freezes, **press and hold the power button for about 6 seconds** until all indicator lights turn off. This will force the power off.<br>:warning:**Please note that this is an emergency procedure, and any unsaved work will be lost**.

## :material-restart: Reset Button

- System Reboot

	When the OS is running, a short press of the reset button will immediately restart the OS.

!!! warning

    This action is similar to a "hard reset" and will not save any open files or work. Use it only when the system is unresponsive and cannot be restarted through the operating system.
