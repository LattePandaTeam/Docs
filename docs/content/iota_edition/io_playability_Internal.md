### Compatible Device

- [**M.2 M-Key Expansion Board**](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2985.html) (for NVMe SSDs or AI  Accelerator Card)
- [**PoE Expansion Board**](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2984.html) (Power over Ethernet for network connectivity)
- Most PCIe expansion boards or HATs for Raspberry Pi 4 or 5

!!! warning "5V Power Output"

    - The 5V power output has two pins and shares a maximum current of 2.2 A.
    - The BIOS default power control is: enable the 5V power output when the OS is running or sleeping; disable the 5V power output when the OS is not running, such as during shutdown or hibernation.


!!! note

    - FPC Cable Required: To connect an expansion board, you will need a compatible 16-pin FPC cable designed for PCIe signals. 
    - Check for Compatibility: While the electrical pinout is compatible, always verify that the specific expansion board or HAT is fully compatible with a generic PCIe host and doesn't rely on Raspberry Pi-specific software overlays.
    - Driver & OS Support: Ensure your operating system (Windows or Linux) has the necessary drivers to support the connected PCIe device. Most standard devices like NVMe drives are supported out-of-the-box by modern operating systems.

### Speaker Audio Output Pins

The `SPK+` and `SPK-` pins form a speaker audio output channel. It  can deliver up to 2 Watt (RMS) / 4 Î©. You can connect a speaker directly to play sound.

When headphones are inserted, the audio output automatically switches to the headphone jack.


### Serial Port TXD RXD Pins

- This serial port is derived from the onboard SuperIO chip and is typically mapped as `COM1` in Windows systems and `/dev/ttyS0` in Linux systems.
-  It supports serial port redirection.
-  Baud Rate: up to 115200

### RP2040 GPIO Pins

- RP2040 communicates with Intel N150 Processor via USB 2.0 CDC (appears as a serial device)
- 3.3V I/O Level
- The GPIO pins of the RP2040 are directly exposed, without series resistors or parallel ESD components.
- **Please refer to the [rp2040_programming](rp2040_programming.md) section for programming guide.**

### USB 2.0 Pins
- D+ / D- lines and power pins exposed for custom USB device integration.
- Can be used to interface with USB-to-serial converters, custom HID devices, or debug probes.
- Directly routed from the processor's PCH and do not use any HUB chips.

- You can also connect our dedicated [**:material-cart: 4G LTE Expansion Board**](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2982.html) to expand cellular connectivity.

### Status Indication Pins

The S0 and S3 pins can indicate the operating system's current state through different output voltages. 

Thus, the operating system status can be obtained by reading these voltages or by connecting LED indicators. 

The pins are already connected in series with 200Î© current-limiting resistors, so most LEDs can be attached directly without risk of burning out.

The voltage of these pins in different states are shown as follows:

|        | Run  | Sleep | Hibernate | Shut Down |
| :----- | :--- | :---- | :-------- | :-------- |
| S0 Pin | High | Low   | Low       | Low       |
| S3 Pin | Low  | High  | Low       | Low       |
