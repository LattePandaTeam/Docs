!!! Note "Mark Pattern"

    - 游릭 Green indicates that the OS can be installed normally. Basic interfaces such as USB, HDMI, PCIe, and SATA can be identified and used without any additional steps.
    - 游댮 Red indicates that the OS cannot be installed completely, either due to some issues.

If you discover that an operating system has undergone a significant update and needs to be retested, or if you wish for us to test additional operating systems, you may create a new issue in [LattePanda Mu repository](https://github.com/LattePandaTeam/LattePanda-Mu/issues), or you can email us at [techsupport@lattepanda.com](mailto:techsupport@lattepanda.com).
