# Operating System

## Linux

The installation process is the same as for regular laptops or desktops. Before installation, it is recommended to check [the operating system compatibility list](os_compatible.md).

For Ubuntu installation, you can refer to [the Ubuntu installation section of the LattePanda Sigma](../../content/sigma_edition/Operating_Systems_Ubuntu.md).

For other Linux installations, you can check the official tutorials of the operating system or search for tutorials on YouTube.



The general steps are as follows:

- Search for and download the version of Linux OS you need.
- Burn the OS image into a USB drive. You can use the [**Rufus**](https://rufus.ie/) for this purpose.
- Plug the USB drive into the LattePanda, and continuously press **++del++** after turning it on to enter the BIOS settings. Configure the LattePanda to boot from the USB drive.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the operating system installation.
- After installation, if you find that some peripherals are not functioning properly, please first try to upgrade the drivers even a newer kernel.
