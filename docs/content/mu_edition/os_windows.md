## Windows Recovery Image

In this section, we will use the Windows 11 recovery image file, which is the Windows 11 image pre-installed on the LattePanda Mu from the factory. This image comes with all hardware drivers and is ready to use, providing you with a fast and ultimate experience.

This image does not update in real-time. Therefore, if you need to install the latest version of the Windows OS, you will need to download it yourself and install the drivers.

The Operating system will be installed on the eMMC by default.

??? tip "How to install the recovery OS image to the SSD?"
    - Insert your SSD into the LattePanda Mu with the carrier board, then remove all other storage.
    - Enter into the BIOS setup to disable the onboard eMMC(`Chipset->PCH-IO Configuration->SCS Configuration->eMMC 5.1 Controller:Disabled`). Then save the change.
